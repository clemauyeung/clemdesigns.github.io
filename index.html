    <h1>Clem Auyeung designs brands, content, and digital products.</h1>
    <p>Hiya, I'm a content strategist, UX writer, and designer working at the intersection of editorial and product experience. I collaborate with teams to design the content that goes into websites, mobile apps, software, and conversational interfaces.</p>
    <p>I use the human-centered design process to help startups, nonprofits, and enterprise companies tackle gnarly content and product challenges. That usually means building empathy with the audience first with data, then iterating on ideas that make a real difference in people's lives.</p>
